# Configuration Overview

gosling uses YAML [configuration files](#configuration-files) to manage settings and extensions. The primary config file is located at:

* macOS/Linux: `~/.config/gosling/config.yaml`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Block\gosling\config\config.yaml`

The configuration files allow you to set default behaviors, configure language models, set tool permissions, and manage extensions. While many settings can also be set using [environment variables](/docs/guides/environment-variables), the config files provide a persistent way to maintain your preferences.

## Configuration Files

- **config.yaml** - Provider, model, extensions, and general settings
- **permission.yaml** - Tool permission levels configured via `gosling configure`
- **secrets.yaml** - API keys and secrets (when gosling is using [file-based secret storage](#security-considerations))
- **permissions/tool_permissions.json** - Runtime permission decisions (auto-managed)
- **prompts/** - Customized [prompt templates](/docs/guides/context-engineering/prompt-templates)
- **data directory/workspaces/workspaces.json** - Versioned, non-secret Desktop [workspace metadata](/docs/guides/workspaces) and active selection (auto-managed)

In addition to editing configuration files directly, many settings can be managed from gosling Desktop and gosling CLI:
- **gosling Desktop**: From the `Settings` page and the bottom toolbar
- **gosling CLI**: Run the `gosling configure` command

## Global Settings

The following settings can be configured at the root level of your config.yaml file:

## Example Configuration

Here's a basic example of a config.yaml file:

```yaml
# Model Configuration
GOSLING_PROVIDER: "anthropic"
GOSLING_MODEL: "claude-4.5-sonnet"
GOSLING_FAILOVER_PROVIDER: "ollama"
GOSLING_FAILOVER_MODEL: "qwen3-coder:latest"
GOSLING_TEMPERATURE: 0.7

# Planning Configuration
GOSLING_PLANNER_PROVIDER: "openai"
GOSLING_PLANNER_MODEL: "gpt-4"

# Tool Configuration
GOSLING_MODE: "smart_approve"
GOSLING_CODE_EXECUTION_RUNTIME: "enabled"
GOSLING_TOOLSHIM: true
GOSLING_CLI_MIN_PRIORITY: 0.2

# Search Path Configuration
GOSLING_SEARCH_PATHS:
  - "/usr/local/bin"
  - "~/custom/tools"
  - "/opt/homebrew/bin"

# External skill catalogs remain in their owning repositories
GOSLING_SKILL_CATALOGS:
  - "/path/to/private-catalog/gosling-skill-catalog.json"

# Security Configuration
SECURITY_PROMPT_ENABLED: true

# Extensions Configuration
extensions:
  developer:
    bundled: true
    enabled: true
    name: developer
    timeout: 300
    type: builtin
  
  memory:
    bundled: true
    enabled: true
    name: memory
    timeout: 300
    type: builtin
```

## Extensions Configuration

Extensions are configured under the `extensions` key. Each extension can have the following settings:

```yaml
extensions:
  extension_name:
    bundled: true/false       # Whether it's included with gosling
    display_name: "Name"      # Human-readable name (optional)
    enabled: true/false       # Whether the extension is active
    name: "extension_name"    # Internal name
    timeout: 300              # Operation timeout in seconds
    type: "builtin"/"stdio"   # Extension type
    available_tools: []       # Filter to specific tools (empty = all)
    
    # Additional settings for stdio extensions:
    cmd: "command"            # Command to execute
    args: ["arg1", "arg2"]    # Command arguments
    description: "text"       # Extension description
    env_keys: []              # Required environment variables
    envs: {}                  # Environment values
```

### Tool Filtering

Use the `available_tools` field to limit which tools are loaded from an extension. List the tool names you want — only those will be available to gosling. Leave it empty (the default) to load all tools. This can help reduce token overhead in sessions where you only need a subset of an extension's capabilities.

## Secret Sources

`env_keys` names the secrets an extension needs. gosling resolves each one from
the environment, then from its own keyring, then from the secrets file. When the
credential belongs to another program, `secret_sources` lets gosling read it
from that program's OS keychain item instead of holding a second copy:

```yaml
secret_sources:
  MUNINN_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN:
    keychain_service: ai.muninn.mcp
    keychain_account: alice      # optional, defaults to $USER

extensions:
  muninn:
    type: streamable_http
    uri: http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp
    env_keys: [MUNINN_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN]
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer $MUNINN_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN"
```

The map is keyed by the same names the extension lists in `env_keys`. A source
is consulted only when the environment and gosling's own store have nothing,
so it never overrides a value you set explicitly, and a missing or malformed
`secret_sources` block leaves every other extension unaffected.

Prefer this over the two alternatives when another program owns the credential.
Copying the value into gosling's keyring makes each rotation a two-step
operation that silently half-fails, and relying on the process environment makes
the value depend on where gosling sits in the login sequence — on macOS a
`launchctl setenv` from a login agent reaches only processes started after it,
so the same machine can succeed or fail from one boot to the next.

If the item cannot be read, gosling reports which keychain item it tried rather
than the generic "secret not found", because a server answers a missing header,
an empty one, and a wrong one with the same 401.

## Search Path Configuration

Extensions may need to execute external commands or tools. By default, gosling uses your system's PATH environment variable. You can add additional search directories in your config file:

```yaml
GOSLING_SEARCH_PATHS:
  - "/usr/local/bin"
  - "~/custom/tools"
  - "/opt/homebrew/bin"
```

These paths are prepended to the system PATH when running extension commands, ensuring your custom tools are found without modifying your global PATH.

## Observability Configuration

Configure gosling to export telemetry to [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) compatible platforms. Environment variables override these settings and support additional options like per-signal configuration. See the [environment variables guide](/docs/guides/environment-variables#observability-configuration) for details.

| Setting | Purpose | Values | Default |
|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| `otel_exporter_otlp_endpoint` | OTLP endpoint URL | URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4318`) | None |
| `otel_exporter_otlp_timeout` | Export timeout in milliseconds | Integer (ms) | 10000 |

```yaml
otel_exporter_otlp_endpoint: "http://localhost:4318"
otel_exporter_otlp_timeout: 20000
```

## Configuration Priority

Settings are applied in the following order of precedence:

1. Environment variables (highest priority)
2. Config file settings
3. Default values (lowest priority)

## Security Considerations

- Avoid storing sensitive information (API keys, tokens) in the config file
- Workspace JSON and workspace exports contain only non-secret profile references and metadata;
  never place API keys or tokens in workspace names, paths, templates, or export files.
- Use the system keyring (keychain on macOS) for storing secrets. When available, this is the recommended option.
- If gosling is using file-based secret storage, secrets are stored in a separate `secrets.yaml` file (in plain text). This can happen when:

  - Your environment does not provide a desktop keyring service (for example: headless servers, CI/CD, containers)
  - You disable the keyring explicitly (via [GOSLING_DISABLE_KEYRING](/docs/guides/environment-variables#security-and-privacy))
  - gosling cannot access the keyring and falls back to file-based secret storage

  For troubleshooting keyring failures and automatic fallback behavior, see [Known Issues](/docs/troubleshooting/known-issues#keyring-cannot-be-accessed-automatic-fallback).

## Updating Configuration

Direct edits to config files usually require restarting gosling to take effect for existing sessions. Gosling2 provider credential/config saves made through Settings use ACP/core to update storage and refresh provider inventory without restarting the app, but currently active chat sessions continue using the provider instance they started with. You can verify your current configuration using:

```bash
gosling info -v
```

This will show all active settings and their current values.
