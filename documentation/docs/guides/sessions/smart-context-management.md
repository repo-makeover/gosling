When working with [Large Language Models (LLMs)](/docs/getting-started/providers), there are limits to how much conversation history they can process at once. gosling provides smart context management features to help handle context and conversation limits so you can maintain productive sessions. Here are some key concepts:

- **Context Length**: The amount of conversation history the LLM can consider, also referred to as the context window
- **Context Limit**: The maximum number of tokens the model can process
- **Context Management**: How gosling handles conversations approaching these limits
- **Turn**: One complete prompt-response interaction between gosling and the LLM

## How gosling Manages Context
gosling uses a two-tiered approach to context management:

1. **Auto-Compaction**: Proactively summarizes conversation when approaching token limits
2. **Context Strategies**: Backup strategy used if the context limit is still exceeded after auto-compaction

This layered approach lets gosling handle token and context limits gracefully.

## Automatic Compaction
gosling automatically compacts (summarizes) older parts of your conversation when approaching token limits, allowing you to maintain long-running sessions without manual intervention. 
Auto-compaction is triggered by default when you reach 80% of the token limit in gosling Desktop and the gosling CLI.

Control the auto-compaction behavior with the `GOSLING_AUTO_COMPACT_THRESHOLD` [environment variable](/docs/guides/environment-variables.md#session-management). 
Disable this feature by setting the value to `0.0`. Values must be finite and less than `1.0`;
`1.0` is rejected by preference/config saves. A positive reduction must be below an enabled
threshold. Invalid reduction settings stop compaction with an error instead of silently selecting full compaction.

```
# Automatically compact sessions when 60% of available tokens are used
export GOSLING_AUTO_COMPACT_THRESHOLD=0.6
```

When you reach the auto-compaction threshold:
  1. gosling will automatically start compacting the conversation to make room.
  2. Once complete, you'll see a confirmation message that the conversation was compacted and summarized.
  3. Continue the session. Your previous conversation remains visible, but only the compacted conversion is included in the active context for gosling.

Auto-compaction targets a level below the threshold rather than fully collapsing the conversation every time — controlled by `GOSLING_AUTO_COMPACT_REDUCTION` (default `0.15`, i.e. 15 percentage points). With the defaults above, crossing 60% usage compacts just enough of the oldest eligible history to bring usage back down to 45%, leaving newer turns untouched until a future pass needs them. This holds regardless of how far past the threshold usage had climbed before the check ran — a conversation that jumps from 40% to 90% in one turn still lands at 45% in a single pass, rather than needing several turns to crawl back down. Set it to `0.0` to always fully collapse the eligible history on every auto-compaction, matching the previous behavior:

```
# Always fully collapse on auto-compaction instead of a partial, threshold-relative trim
export GOSLING_AUTO_COMPACT_REDUCTION=0.0
```

A manual `/compact` (below) always fully collapses the conversation regardless of this setting.

To keep the exchange you're actively working in fully intact, gosling never summarizes the most recent turns — by default the last 10 real turns (a turn is one user message plus gosling's response) are kept verbatim, and everything older is folded into the summary. Adjust this with `GOSLING_COMPACT_PROTECT_LAST_N_TURNS`:

```
# Keep the last 20 turns verbatim instead of the default 10
export GOSLING_COMPACT_PROTECT_LAST_N_TURNS=20
```

History older than the protected turns isn't compressed evenly either. It's summarized in fixed-size blocks going backward from that cutoff, and each block gets progressively less summarization budget the further back it is — so turns from a few blocks ago keep noticeably more detail than turns from deep in the session's past, instead of the whole history being diluted to one flat, evenly-terse summary.

Compaction requests are bounded independently from the conversation that triggered
them. Gosling sends fixed-size instructions, splits large histories into ordered
chunks, summarizes those chunks, and reduces the summaries into one continuation
context. Provider context-limit errors cause smaller bounded retries. Original
history is replaced only after the final summary succeeds and cancellation is checked.
For a compacted Desktop resume, the loaded tail is compacted in memory only; it never replaces
the full stored transcript. A failure after a durable replacement explicitly reports that compaction
was saved, rather than claiming the original session is intact.

If every bounded retry is rejected, Gosling leaves the original session intact.
You can switch to another configured provider, run `/compact`, and then switch back;
or start a new session with the essential context. Switching providers does not
repair damaged session data—it simply lets a route with different request limits
perform the same provider-neutral compaction.

:::tip Customize Compaction
You can customize how gosling summarizes conversations during compaction by editing the `compaction.md` [prompt template](/docs/guides/context-engineering/prompt-templates).
:::

:::tip Tool Output Summarization
To help maintain efficient context usage, gosling summarizes older tool call outputs in the background while keeping recent calls in full detail. By default, this happens when you have more than 10 tool calls in a session. For advanced tuning, see [`GOSLING_TOOL_CALL_CUTOFF`](/docs/guides/environment-variables#session-management).
:::

### Manual Compaction
You can also trigger compaction manually before reaching context or token limits:

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="gosling Desktop" default>

  1. Point to the token usage indicator dot next to the model name at the bottom of the app
  2. Click <ScrollText className="inline" size={16} /> `Compact now` in the context window that appears
  3. Once complete, you'll see a confirmation message that the conversation was compacted and summarized.
  4. Continue the session. Your previous conversation remains visible, but only the compacted conversion is included in the active context for gosling.

  :::info 
  You must send at least one message in the chat before the `Compact now` button is enabled. 
  :::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="gosling CLI" default>

To proactively trigger summarization before reaching context limits, use the `/summarize` command:

```sh
( O)> /summarize
◇  Are you sure you want to summarize this conversation? This will condense the message history.
│  Yes 
│
Summarizing conversation...
Conversation has been summarized.
Key information has been preserved while reducing context length.
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Context Limit Strategies

When auto-compaction is disabled, or if a conversation still exceeds the context limit, gosling offers different ways to handle it:

| Feature | Description | Best For | Availability | Impact |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Summarization** | Condenses conversation while preserving key points | Long, complex conversations | Desktop and CLI | Maintains most context |
| **Truncation** | Removes oldest messages to make room | Simple, linear conversations | CLI only | Loses old context |
| **Clear** | Starts fresh while keeping session active | New direction in conversation | CLI only | Loses all context |
| **Prompt** | Asks user to choose from the above options | Control over each decision in interactive sessions | CLI only | Depends on choice made |

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="gosling Desktop" default>

gosling Desktop exclusively uses summarization by compacting the conversation to manage context, preserving key information while reducing size.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="gosling CLI">

The CLI supports all context limit strategies: `summarize`, `truncate`, `clear`, and `prompt`. 

The default behavior depends on the mode you're running in:
- **Interactive mode**: Prompts user to choose (equivalent to `prompt`)
- **Headless mode** (`gosling run`): Automatically summarizes (equivalent to `summarize`)

You can configure how gosling handles context limits by setting the `GOSLING_CONTEXT_STRATEGY` environment variable:

```bash
# Set automatic strategy (choose one)
export GOSLING_CONTEXT_STRATEGY=summarize  # Automatically summarize (recommended)
export GOSLING_CONTEXT_STRATEGY=truncate   # Automatically remove oldest messages
export GOSLING_CONTEXT_STRATEGY=clear      # Automatically clear session

# Set to prompt the user
export GOSLING_CONTEXT_STRATEGY=prompt
```

When you hit the context limit, the behavior depends on your configuration:

**With default settings (no `GOSLING_CONTEXT_STRATEGY` set)**, you'll see this prompt to choose a management option:

```sh
◇  The model's context length is maxed out. You will need to reduce the # msgs. Do you want to?
│  ○ Clear Session   
│  ○ Truncate Message
// highlight-start
│  ● Summarize Session
// highlight-end

final_summary: [A summary of your conversation will appear here]

Context maxed out
--------------------------------------------------
gosling summarized messages for you.
```

**With `GOSLING_CONTEXT_STRATEGY` configured**, gosling will automatically apply your chosen strategy:

```sh
# Example with GOSLING_CONTEXT_STRATEGY=summarize
Context maxed out - automatically summarized messages.
--------------------------------------------------
gosling automatically summarized messages for you.

# Example with GOSLING_CONTEXT_STRATEGY=truncate
Context maxed out - automatically truncated messages.
--------------------------------------------------
gosling tried its best to truncate messages for you.

# Example with GOSLING_CONTEXT_STRATEGY=clear
Context maxed out - automatically cleared session.
--------------------------------------------------
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Maximum Turns
The `Max Turns` limit is the maximum number of consecutive turns that gosling can take without user input (default: 1000). When the limit is reached, gosling stops and prompts: "I've reached the maximum number of actions I can do without user input. Would you like me to continue?" If the user answers in the affirmative, gosling continues until the limit is reached and then prompts again.

This feature gives you control over agent autonomy and prevents infinite loops and runaway behavior, which could have significant cost consequences or damaging impact in production environments. Use it for:

- Preventing infinite loops and excessive API calls or resource consumption in automated tasks
- Enabling human supervision or interaction during autonomous operations
- Controlling loops while testing and debugging agent behavior

This setting is stored as the `GOSLING_MAX_TURNS` environment variable in your [config.yaml file](/docs/guides/config-files). You can configure it using the Desktop app or CLI.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
    <TabItem value="ui" label="gosling Desktop" default>

      1. Click the <PanelLeft className="inline" size={16} /> button in the top-left to open the sidebar
      2. Click the `Settings` button on the sidebar
      3. Click the `Chat` tab 
      4. Scroll to `Conversation Limits` and enter a value for `Max Turns`
        
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="gosling CLI">

      1. Run the `configuration` command:
      ```sh
      gosling configure
      ```

      2. Select `gosling settings`:
      ```sh
      ┌   gosling-configure
      │
      ◆  What would you like to configure?
      │  ○ Configure Providers
      │  ○ Add Extension
      │  ○ Toggle Extensions
      │  ○ Remove Extension
      // highlight-start
      │  ● gosling settings (Set the gosling mode, Tool Output, Tool Permissions, Experiment and more)
      // highlight-end
      └ 
      ```

      3. Select `Max Turns`:
      ```sh
      ┌   gosling-configure
      │
      ◇  What would you like to configure?
      │  gosling settings
      │
      ◆  What setting would you like to configure?
      │  ○ gosling mode 
      │  ○ Router Tool Selection Strategy 
      │  ○ Tool Permission 
      │  ○ Tool Output 
      // highlight-start
      │  ● Max Turns (Set maximum number of turns without user input)
      // highlight-end
      │  ○ Toggle Experiment 
      └ 
      ```

      4. Enter the maximum number of turns:
      ```sh
      ┌   gosling-configure 
      │
      ◇  What would you like to configure?
      │  gosling settings 
      │
      ◇  What setting would you like to configure?
      │  Max Turns 
      │
        // highlight-start
      ◆  Set maximum number of agent turns without user input:
      │  10
        // highlight-end
      │
      └  Set maximum turns to 10 - gosling will ask for input after 10 consecutive actions
      ```

      :::tip
      In addition to the persistent `Max Turns` setting, you can provide a runtime override for a specific session or task via the `gosling session --max-turns` and `gosling run --max-turns` [CLI commands](/docs/guides/gosling-cli-commands).
      :::

    </TabItem>
    
</Tabs>

**Choosing the Right Value**

The appropriate max turns value depends on your use case and comfort level with automation:

- **5-10 turns**: Good for exploratory tasks, debugging, or when you want frequent check-ins. For example, "analyze this codebase and suggest improvements" where you want to review each step
- **25-50 turns**: Effective for well-defined tasks with moderate complexity, such as "refactor this module to use the new API" or "set up a basic CI/CD pipeline"
- **100+ turns**: More suitable for complex, multi-step automation where you trust gosling to work independently, like "migrate this entire project from React 16 to React 18" or "implement comprehensive test coverage for this service"

Remember that even simple-seeming tasks often require multiple turns. For example, asking gosling to "fix the failing tests" might involve analyzing test output (1 turn), identifying the root cause (1 turn), making code changes (1 turn), and verifying the fix (1 turn).

## Token Usage
After sending your first message, gosling Desktop and gosling CLI display token usage.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
    <TabItem value="ui" label="gosling Desktop" default>
    The Desktop displays token usage next to the model name at the bottom of the session window. The numerator is usage from the **last model request**, not an estimate of a future compaction request. The denominator is the active provider route's effective context limit when that route reports one. Public API and subscription-route limits for the same model name can differ.

    The color provides a visual indicator of the last request's usage:
      - **Green**: Normal usage - Plenty of context space available
      - **Orange**: Warning state - Approaching limit (80% of capacity)
      - **Red**: Error state - Context limit reached
    
    Hover over this circle to display:
      - The number of tokens used
      - The percentage of available tokens used
      - The total available tokens
      - A progress bar showing your current token usage
        
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="gosling CLI">
    The CLI displays a context label above each command prompt, showing:
      - A visual indicator using dots (●○) and colors to represent your token usage:
        - **Green**: Below 50% usage
        - **Yellow**: Between 50-85% usage
        - **Red**: Above 85% usage
      - Usage percentage
      - Current token count and context limit

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Model Context Limit Overrides

Context limits are automatically detected based on your model name, but gosling provides settings to override the default limits:

| Model | Description | Best For | Setting |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Main** | Set context limit for the main model (also serves as fallback for other models) | LiteLLM proxies, custom models with non-standard names | `GOSLING_CONTEXT_LIMIT` |
| **Planner** | Set context for [planner models](/docs/guides/context-engineering/creating-plans) | Large planning tasks requiring extensive context | `GOSLING_PLANNER_CONTEXT_LIMIT` |

:::info
This setting supplies a fallback or explicit model configuration. Providers that
report route-specific capabilities can supply a lower effective limit for request
budgeting and display. The provider still enforces the final request limit.
:::

This feature is particularly useful with:

- **LiteLLM Proxy Models**: When using LiteLLM with custom model names that don't match gosling's patterns
- **Enterprise Deployments**: Custom model deployments with non-standard naming  
- **Fine-tuned Models**: Custom models with different context limits than their base versions
- **Development/Testing**: Temporarily adjusting context limits for testing purposes

gosling resolves context limits with the following precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Explicit context_limit in model configuration (if set programmatically)
2. Specific environment variable (e.g., `GOSLING_PLANNER_CONTEXT_LIMIT`)
3. Global environment variable (`GOSLING_CONTEXT_LIMIT`)
4. Model-specific default based on name pattern matching
5. Global default (128,000 tokens)

**Configuration**

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="gosling Desktop" default>

     Model context limit overrides are not yet available in the gosling Desktop app.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="gosling CLI">

    Context limit overrides only work as [environment variables](/docs/guides/environment-variables#model-context-limit-overrides), not in the config file.

    ```bash
    export GOSLING_CONTEXT_LIMIT=1000
    gosling session
    ```

  </TabItem>
    
</Tabs>

**Scenarios**

1. LiteLLM proxy with custom model name

```bash
# LiteLLM proxy with custom model name
export GOSLING_PROVIDER="openai"
export GOSLING_MODEL="my-custom-gpt4-proxy"
export GOSLING_CONTEXT_LIMIT=200000  # Override the 32k default
```

2. Planner setup with a different context limit

```bash
# Set a larger context window for planning
export GOSLING_PLANNER_MODEL="claude-opus-custom"
export GOSLING_PLANNER_CONTEXT_LIMIT=500000
```

3. Planner with large context

```bash
# Large context for complex planning
export GOSLING_PLANNER_MODEL="gpt-4-custom"
export GOSLING_PLANNER_CONTEXT_LIMIT=1000000
```

## Credit Balance Monitoring

gosling monitors your API provider balance and warns you when credits are running low or exhausted. When this happens, you'll see an **Insufficient Credits** notification.

For providers that support it (such as [Tetrate Agent Router Service](https://router.tetrate.ai)), the notification includes an **Add credits** button that takes you directly to your provider's billing page.

**What to do:**
1. Click the **Add credits** button (if available) to top up your account
2. Or visit your provider's dashboard manually to add credits
3. Once credits are added, resend your message to continue the conversation

:::tip
gosling detects low balance conditions automatically, so you won't lose your conversation context—just add credits and pick up where you left off.
:::

**Supported providers:** Tetrate Agent Router Service, OpenRouter, and other providers that report balance information via HTTP 402 responses.

## Cost Tracking
Display real-time estimated costs of your session.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
    <TabItem value="ui" label="gosling Desktop" default>
To manage live cost tracking:
  1. Click the <PanelLeft className="inline" size={16} /> button in the top-left to open the sidebar
  2. Click the `Settings` button on the sidebar
  3. Click the `App` tab 
  4. Toggle `Cost Tracking` on/off

The session cost is shown at the bottom of the gosling window and updates dynamically as tokens are consumed. Hover over the cost to see a detailed breakdown of token usage. If multiple models are used in the session, this includes a cost breakdown by model. Ollama and local deployments always show a cost of $0.00.

Pricing data is regularly fetched from the OpenRouter API and cached locally. The `Advanced settings` tab shows when the data was last updated and allows you to refresh. 

These costs are estimates only, and not connected to your actual provider bill. The cost shown is an approximation based on token counts and public pricing data.
</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="gosling CLI">
    Show estimated cost in the gosling CLI by setting the `GOSLING_CLI_SHOW_COST` [environment variable](/docs/guides/environment-variables.md#session-management) or including it in the [configuration file](/docs/guides/config-files.md).

  ```
  # Set environment variable
  export GOSLING_CLI_SHOW_COST=true

  # config.yaml
  GOSLING_CLI_SHOW_COST: true
